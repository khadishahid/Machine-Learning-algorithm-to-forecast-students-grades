# Student Grades Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning classification model to predict whether a student will fail a course based on various features from their academic data. The task is supervised learning, where labeled data is used to train the model. The primary goal is to analyze student performance and classify them into groups to forecast outcomes.

Key performance metrics used to evaluate the model include:
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive outcomes to all positive outcomes predicted by the model.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive outcomes to all actual positive outcomes.
- **F1 Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall to provide a balanced measure of the modelâ€™s performance.

## Dataset
The dataset is loaded from the file `student-mat.csv`, which contains various attributes related to student performance.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are imported.
- The dataset is loaded using `pandas` for further exploration and analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the relationships between features and target variables.

### 3. Model Building
- A machine learning model is developed to predict the student's final grade category.
- Various classification models are explored, and their performances are compared using the specified evaluation metrics.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
